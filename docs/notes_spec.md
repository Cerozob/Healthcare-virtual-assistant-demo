# Notes and spec

Este documento especifica el contexto y el alcance del proyecto para el AWSome Builder 2.

## Contexto

### Problem

A Healthcare company (AnyCompany), with no experience in the cloud and a limited expertise in the AI field finds that registering patient data, use medical input and leveraging that information to assign and schedule the medical exams and treatments that each patient needs is a highly manual and error-prone process.

### Solution

The proposed solution for AnyCompany is to build an AI system with chatbot-like capabilities in order to provide an interface for the medics to help them save notes and commentaries about the patients’ symptoms. And agentic capabilities in order to automate the schedule of the exams and treatments that each patient has to do, based on company documents and the patient symptoms noted by the medic. The objective is to build an architecture that satisfies these requirements, recommending relevant AWS products and services to build and integrate LLM-based chatbots with company data sources while meeting security and healthcare regulations and compliance norms.

### Use Case

AnyCompany needs help to: Build a conversational interface for the AI-powered chatbot. Connect the Chatbot to internal company patients, diagnosis and exam data. Set up the chatbot to automate the exams scheduling process. Deploying the solution while being able to scale to meet the medics needs and avoid wasting resources. And ensuring that the architecture complies with healthcare focused security and privacy requirements.
